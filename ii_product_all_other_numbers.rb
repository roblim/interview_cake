=begin
You have an array of integers, and for each index you want to find the product of every integer except the integer at that index.
Write a method get_products_of_all_ints_except_at_index() that takes an array of integers and returns an array of the products.

For example, given:

  [1, 7, 3, 4]

your method would return:

  [84, 12, 28, 21]

by calculating:

  [7 * 3 * 4,  1 * 3 * 4,  1 * 7 * 4,  1 * 7 * 3]

Do not use division in your solution.
